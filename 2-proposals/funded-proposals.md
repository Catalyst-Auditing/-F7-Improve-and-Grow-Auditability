# Funded Proposals

## Contact guidelines

#### Email sent 4th March 2022&#x20;

Dear Challenge Teams, and Fund7 projects,\
\
Catalyst has now onboarded all of the Fund7 funded projects and the first payment run is taking place soon. \
\
Each Challenge Team is being provided a contact sheet of all the funded-project teams in each Challenge cohort. Each funded project in a Challenge cohort is also BCC’d in this email so that everyone is aware of this effort.\
\
From this point, Challenge Teams should make contact with the funded projects and coordinate as per the Challenge Team deliverables, to provide a point of contact to help funded project teams and to provide an ongoing retrospective on how each challenge is performing. \
&#x20;\
How Challenge Teams coordinate this is up to each group. However, a guideline framework of expectation could be:&#x20;

1. Challenge Teams create a regular touchpoint with the Challenge funded-projects&#x20;
2. Challenge Teams may wish to divide the cohort between them,\
   (1 Challenge Team member per 4 projects for example)
3. Decide which day, hour, formats to meet and communicate (zoom, telegram, slack/huddle, discord server)&#x20;
4. Provide more than a text chat only - for example, “office hours” to meet once a month, a chance for each project to give a short update (e.g. 4X 20 min slots per month feels right for 1 Challenge Team member working with 4 projects)
5. Funded projects give a short presentation of work to date and Challenge Team member feeds back. Anything they can help guide towards (KPIs for example)?
6. Each 1:1 meeting should be private, this intimacy will be better for sharing issues &#x20;
7. Challenge Teams are supporting roles more like mentors, not a manager or auditor
8. Challenge Teams can provide a summary of outcomes to the Catalyst Community &#x20;
9.
   * This is up to Challenge Teams to decide the format &#x20;
   * Town Hall presentations could be great, so could a written report, so could a video. It's up to you.&#x20;
   * Why this approach? Well honestly, we don’t know what the best format is! This pilot will hopefully lead to lessons learned and converge on a happy-path format for future Challenge Teams to follow.&#x20;
10. As much as possible Challenge Teams and Funded-projects should be self-sufficient
11. Catalyst will review the purpose of bi-weekly Coordinator meetings during this pilot. &#x20;

We will be holding a Challenge Teams roundtable in the next fortnight, so we can get a sense of how the initiative is going. Please remember this is still a pilot, so things may break!&#x20;
