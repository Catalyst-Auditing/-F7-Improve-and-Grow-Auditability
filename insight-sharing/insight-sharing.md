## Insight Sharing Workshops

[QADAO ](https://quality-assurance-dao.github.io)in collaboration with Catalyst School prepared an Insight Sharing Workshop as part of the funded proposal "[Insight Sharing Workshops - TCS](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384064)".

### What are Insight Sharing Workshops? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-14be6570-7fff-5a4b-d3bd-88c708f41b30" id="docs-internal-guid-14be6570-7fff-5a4b-d3bd-88c708f41b30"></a>

The Insight Sharing Workshop Series is a new way of brainstorming about Catalyst Challenges, aiming to bring together proposers, community advisors, challenge teams and domain experts into a discussion about specific challenges and how to make the best out of it.

Taking place at the beginning of Fund 8 during the insight sharing phase. Domain experts will have a list of recommended topics to be covered but are free to modify them, include or exclude topics as they see fit.

### Execution <a href="#docs-internal-guid-6d3c725b-7fff-4d51-d5ef-bfd0530add3c" id="docs-internal-guid-6d3c725b-7fff-4d51-d5ef-bfd0530add3c"></a>

The workshops take place in Zoom meetings and will last up to 2 hours. One or two domain experts will be invited to participate, and one or two Catalyst School members will be there to provide all the required support. The meeting recording will be uploaded to [Catalyst Schoolâ€™s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPvRvMoxhmHLUuPPcsMmmg/videos).

The goal is to have an interactive, open conversation with everyone. Presenters decide the details of the presentation, but the idea is to leave space for everyone to interact and share their perspectives.

### Workshop topics (preferable):

* Slides
* Presentation of the challenge
* Proposer perspective (What topics should cover/focus a proposer)
* CA perspective (What topics should cover/focus on a CA in the assessments)
* Explanation of challenge KPIs&#x20;
* Overview of previously funded proposals / Success stories (if applicable)
