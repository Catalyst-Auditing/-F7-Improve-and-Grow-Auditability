## Insight Sharing Workshops

[QADAO ](https://quality-assurance-dao.github.io)in collaboration with Catalyst School prepared an Insight Sharing Workshop as part of the funded proposal "[Insight Sharing Workshops - TCS](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384064)".

### What are Insight Sharing Workshops? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-14be6570-7fff-5a4b-d3bd-88c708f41b30" id="docs-internal-guid-14be6570-7fff-5a4b-d3bd-88c708f41b30"></a>

Adapted from [Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rN7dWXLH\_v2UQI3mcMP1uoosQ2FrHLwZJSIpx9tMqYI/edit?usp=sharing)

The Insight Sharing Workshop Series is a new way of brainstorming about Catalyst Challenges, aiming to bring together proposers, community advisors, challenge teams and domain experts into a discussion about specific challenges and how to make the best out of it.

Taking place at the beginning of Fund 8 during the insight sharing phase. Domain experts will have a list of recommended topics to be covered but are free to modify them, include or exclude topics as they see fit.

### Execution <a href="#docs-internal-guid-6d3c725b-7fff-4d51-d5ef-bfd0530add3c" id="docs-internal-guid-6d3c725b-7fff-4d51-d5ef-bfd0530add3c"></a>

The workshops take place in Zoom meetings and will last up to 2 hours. One or two domain experts will be invited to participate, and one or two Catalyst School members will be there to provide all the required support. The meeting recording will be uploaded to [Catalyst School’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPvRvMoxhmHLUuPPcsMmmg/videos).

The goal is to have an interactive, open conversation with everyone. Presenters decide the details of the presentation, but the idea is to leave space for everyone to interact and share their perspectives.

### Workshop topics (preferable):

* Slides
* Presentation of the challenge
* Proposer perspective (What topics should cover/focus a proposer)
* CA perspective (What topics should cover/focus on a CA in the assessments)
* Explanation of challenge KPIs
* Overview of previously funded proposals / Success stories (if applicable)

The Insight Sharing Workshop Series is a new way of brainstorming about Catalyst Challenges

Aiming to bring together :

* Proposers
* Community advisors
* Challenge teams
* Domain experts

into a discussion about specific challenges and how to make the best out of it.

The Series is the product of an "[Insight Sharing Workshops - TCS](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384064)" proposal submitted in the Fund 7 [Community Events Challenge](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26234/about) and successfully voted for in February 2022.

The Insight Sharing phase of each Catalyst Fund provides an opportunity to fill in your unique perspective on a challenge :

What gaps do you see in how this challenge is currently addressed ?

How can we improve the challenge brief ?

What wild thoughts do you have about how to best address this challenge ?

### The Improve & Grow Auditability Challenge

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-21 (14).png>)

The **Improve & Grow Auditability Challenge** was first proposed in April 2021 by Rodrigo Pacini in Fund 5 with his [F5: Fund 6 & 7 challenge setting Improve and Grow Auditability](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/352101).

It was [successfully voted for in August 2021](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/august-2021/fund-5-voting-results-august-2021#fund-6-challenge-setting) with 1800 Wallets, 164,854,742 ADA FOR & 144 Wallets, 41,493,373 AGAINST.

The Challenge has been renewed through Funds 6, 7 and 8.

### Challenge Summary

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-21 (16).png>)

The Challenge Summary asked

How to make the auditing process of funded proposals

**Efficient** – to address concerns about reporting & auditing overhead

**Distributed** – to use the Cadano blockchain technology to innovate auditability

And **Transparent** – to deliver solutions which provide accountability & to allow open source access

### Challenge Brief

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-21 (17).png>)

The Challenge Brief addresses three main concerns :

#### **1) Audit of Funded Proposal delivery and Return on Intention**

When Fund7 happens we will be close to 300 funded proposals. It is extremely important that these proposals are evaluated/audited to see if they are delivering and if the Return on Intention is being in line with what has been established initially.

#### **2) Supporting transfer of reporting from IOHK**

Currently, IOG is in charge of monitoring the development of these funded proposals, but when there are hundreds of funded proposals this will be an overwhelming work for IOG. So proposals that support a transfer of reporting from IOHK are a priority.

#### **3) Transparency in the use of Cardano's treasury resources**

The Auditability challenge aims to ensure transparency in the use of Cardano's treasury resources, which will allow the Cardano community to have more information on the development of funded proposals through a checks and balances system.

#### Why is it important?

It's important that the funded proposals are evaluated to see if they are delivering what was established in their mission..

#### What does success look like?

Several projects evaluating funded proposals, providing reports, articles and metrics on the development and implementation of the projects.

### Key Metrics to measure

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-21 (18).png>)

#### **1) Number of funded proposals audited**

#### 2) Sensitivity to different –Challenges

It is notable that emphasis is given to consideration of auditing and reporting in different challenges. Therefore success metrics and assessment approaches need to be thought out in relation to each challenge individually.

#### 3) Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts on Audit indicators

Such as Performance, Achievements, Financials, Number of onboarded developers. Number of commits in funded proposal repositories (Github),Indicators of: transactions, volume and unique wallets interacting with dapps, Number of smart contracts audited & Social media engagement indicators.

The emphasis here is on documentation, communication, and social media. How to tell the qualitative story as well as quantifying a proposal.

Please note that Auditability may include Auditing, Quality Assurance and Oversight&#x20;
