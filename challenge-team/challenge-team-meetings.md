### Brief Introductions

### F8 Proposal Submission Phase

> How would we like to support any proposal submissions in the F8 Auditability Challenge ?

Thorsten - Building relationships. We are here to help. Opportunity to use knowledge of Challenge Team for feedback and improvements

\
Naveed - Engaging early - mechanics of process - feedback as Challenge team. Contact immediately with an introduction message.



Vanessa - IOG extending submission deadline to 17th March 2022. Not our role to evaluate proposals. Don’t comment as a team on quality of proposal just the mechanistic stuff - be discreet - contract personally on errors.

\
Stephen – Only submit a brief message; “You can can contact us if you need support” Supporting and advising. Not asessing. Do advice as individuals.

Eric - Send a statement out - offer experience & suggestions - contact & network&#x20;

Jo - Look at each other proposals - Ideascale is open platform - contact first planning comments.

Vanessa - should advise as individuals - as member of community

Jo - From the brief: “Think of Challenge Teams as a project liaison role - you are the eyes and ears of the health of each challenge. You care about its outcomes and are willing to get up close to the winning teams in order to understand the nuances of their projects and communicate this back to the Catalyst community.”\
\
If we are closer to the teams in the proposal stages we will get better quality proposals for the challenge on the execution stage. We shouldn’t worry about setting precident for the rest of the challenge teams.

Thorsten - Agree on pick up on errors - the quality of the Challenge  should be individual - not speaking for the group - intervene on basic quality&#x20;

### How can we assist to ensure the proposals can be executed? - Eric

Improve & Grow Auditability is Unique from other Catalyst categories, as nothing can really be implemented without the support and permission of Catalyst. Prospers will usually not have access to all the data they may need from funded projects to execute their plans. We need a way to ensure that funded projects in this category can work with Catalyst to have the authority/permission to be implemented, or most of the money will be wasted on ideas that cannot be executed.&#x20;

Eric – What is the relationship with IOG to ensure that the data from the community is available to be audited? Are we able to have a clear mandate so that if the community vote on a proposal for auditing, that is able to be implemented in whatever way – on ideascale or other platform. What is the commitment from IOG to enable the community to audit the proposals.

Changing requirements etc.

### Funded Proposal baseline - Thorsten

#### Proposal stage:

Quality criteria up front in proposals (meeting a standard related to a point of reference)

#### Funded stage:

“Comply or explain”&#x20;

“What are the funds you receive actually used for”

Can we create a point of reference from previous funded proposals.
